Stellaria: A Figure-Based Space Shooting Game

=============================================

Stellari Studio, 2011. 

Designed and Programmed by Mingjing Zhang 

from

Vision Research Lab @ University of Science and Technology of China


* Please note that this is a tech demo and is far from a completed game. *
* All I want to do is to demonstrate what MATLAB is capable of. *


About the Code
--------------

I wrote all code myself except for the midi synthesizer.

I apologize for the for-loop overwhelmed, global variable laden, poorly commented, ill-organized and therefore highly inefficient code.

However this is the best I can do for now.



Installation
------------

Put the folder StellariaTechDemo anywhere you like,
then Add StellariaTechDemo and all its subfolders in the search path list.

!Run stl_StellariaMain to play!


Gameplay
--------

Stellaria is just like the arcade shoot-em-up you have played before, except for the sad music.

Stellaria supports two players.

Each player has 30 lives and 3 bombs. 

There are no power-ups, no boss, no score.

There is only 1 stage.

No text information will be displayed on the screen

The game can be slow when there are over 50 objects on the screen (For my i7 2.8GHz + 6 GB RAM +GTX480 computer, 
this number could reach over a 100 without any significant frame dropping). Anyway, you need a better-than-average computer to play this game.


Control
-------

Player 1:  WSAD - Movement, U - Fire, I - Bomb;
Player 2:  DirKeys - Movement, Insert - Fire, Delete - Bomb;
You may skip the opening scene and credits screen by pressing 1 or 2
. They stands for 1 player and 2 players, respectively.


Graphics
--------

Most graphical contents used in this game are the creation of Hamukorosama.

Music
-----

The background music used in this game are composed by Shi Jin (Chinese: Ê¯½ø)

Toolboxes
---------

The capability of playing midi music is granted by the  MIDI synthesizer written by Kenneth Adams, Jr. at GaTech
This synthesizer is available for download at
http://www.prism.gatech.edu/~kadams6/matlab.shtml

The synthesizer comes as a part of Stellaria. You DO NOT need to download it separately.

The synthesizer has been slightly modified by the author of this game.
